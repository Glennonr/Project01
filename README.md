# Project01
First Sprint

Sprint Goal: To reverse engineer the code base and understand how the game Warring Nations is played. Draw a UML diagram (using LucidChart) of the project. Make sure the UML diagram is labled with the team name and members. You are to have one team member fork this repository and then invite all other team members, and Dr. Schaper, to be collaborators. My email is schaperg@moravian.edu.
